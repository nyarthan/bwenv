# bwenv

## Installation

Using `cargo`
```sh
cargo install --git ssh://git@github.com/titanom/bwenv-rs.git
```

> **Note**  
> `cargo` uses libgit2 by default, which comes with many shortcomings regarding authentication.
> Make sure to set `net.git-fetch-with-cli = true` in your cargo config (`~/.cargo/config.toml`)

```toml
[net]
git-fetch-with-cli = true
```
